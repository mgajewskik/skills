# Feature

**You own the design. Plan, review, verify.** Delegate implementation. Stay in the lead. A SIMPLE change (**Size the task first** in work-mode's `SKILL.md`) skips this playbook's steps and delegation.

1. `how` over the affected subsystem.
2. `architect` for parallel design exploration.
3. Write the throughput checkpoint as four todo items. A dimension that genuinely does not apply (single file, no fan-out) keeps its item with `n/a: <reason>` rather than being dropped:
   - **Blocking first steps.** Gates run before fan-out.
   - **Independent workstreams.** Disjoint files, services, or layers parallelize. Shared writes serialize.
   - **Shared mutable state.** Default to splitting the target (**principle-separate-before-serializing-shared-state**). Serialize only for real invariants.
   - **Smallest safe decomposition.** If one worker is best, name why.
4. Delegate code-writing to a subagent with a specific scope: file paths, the named data shape and its organizing structure chosen before the delegate writes logic (**principle-model-the-domain**: a state machine over scattered booleans, a table or registry over branching, a typed model over repeated shape assumptions), and success criteria. When the implementation admits multiple valid shapes (error handling, abstraction layer, test structure), delegate via the **arena** skill instead, so the runners surface the alternatives and the cross-judge guards the pick. The delegation is mandatory: the gain is review separation, not lines saved, so the Laziness Protocol does not override it. A subagent that cannot spawn satisfies it by owning the diff directly with the same review separation. Comments only for a non-obvious why. Surgical edits; re-ground against the source for upstream-derived files. Port shared-primitive improvements to all consumers and verify each. Commit liberally.
5. Verify on the matching surface: drive the real CLI, HTTP endpoint, or test harness yourself, or the project's verification skill (generate one with **create-verification-skill** when there is none). "Inconclusive" or wrong-surface is not a pass. Flag it.
6. Rebase your unpushed commits into small, ordered commits. Stack follow-ups. Use **principle-sequence-verifiable-units**, building, verifying, and committing each small unit before the next.
7. If the design is contested, `interrogate` before shipping.
8. Run **Opening a PR** when the change is meant for review.

Code-coupled work (one feature, one migration) goes to a single owner with the checkpoint inline. That owner fans out internally after the blocking phase. Parent-level fan-out is for slices that produce independent artifacts (audits, cross-subsystem investigations, competing experiments). Rewrite the checkpoint at phase boundaries. Spawn a fresh owner rather than chaining interrupts.

**Reply.** What you built, what you chose and why, the throughput checkpoint, open decisions. Tables for design alternatives.
